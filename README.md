# EAC_Bioinf_Training

This repository hosts bioinformatics training materials developed for the East African Community (EAC) **Training-of-Trainers (ToT)** initiative. The materials are designed to build capacity in genomic surveillance, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) monitoring, and pathogen NGS data analysis in public health laboratories across the EAC region.

## 🧬 Overview

The content is tailored to regional bioinformaticians, public health scientists, and trainers. It includes:

- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Linux/Bash-based analysis scripts
- Genomic data analysis pipelines
- Introductory and advanced training slides
- Sample scripts for QC, taxonomic classification, and AMR analysis
